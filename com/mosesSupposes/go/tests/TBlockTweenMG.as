You can see	 * below that I accept a properties array and a corresponding endVals array,	 * kinda like ZigoEngine worked. It also has an addProperty() method to let	 * you tack properties on one at a time, but no straight properties like	 * x or y, just two arrays.	 * 	 * Open up BlockTweenMG, I want you to see how extremely simple it is.	 * 	 * Next, open the test file TBlockParserMG...	 * 	 * @author Moses Gunesch	 */	public class TBlockTweenMG extends GoTestBase {				public function TBlockTweenMG() 		{			var targ:Sprite = super.box();						// BlockTweenMG example			var t : BlockTweenMG = new BlockTweenMG(targ,										["x","y","rotation","scaleX","scaleY"],									[200, 200, 180, 5, 5],									0, 									2,									Back.easeInOut									);			super.addButtonUI(t, 1);		}	}}
